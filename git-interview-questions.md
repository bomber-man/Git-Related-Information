# Git Interview Questions and Answers

This document provides **90 Git interview questions** with detailed answers, divided into three levels: Foundation, Proficient, and Advanced.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Foundation Level (Beginner)

### 1. What is Git?
Git is a **distributed version control system** that helps track changes in source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. Unlike centralized systems, every developer has a complete local copy of the repository.

### 2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
- **Git**: A version control system to track code changes.
- **GitHub**: A cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories with collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and CI/CD integration.

### 3. How do you check the current Git version?
```bash
git --version
```

### 4. What is a Git repository?
A Git repository is a **data structure that stores metadata and object database** for a project. It can be local (on your machine) or remote (on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

### 5. How do you initialize a new Git repository?
```bash
git init
```
This creates a new `.git` folder to track project changes.

### 6. How do you clone an existing Git repository?
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 7. What are Git branches?
Branches allow developers to **work on features independently**. The `main` (or `master`) branch is typically the default branch.

### 8. How do you create a new branch?
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

### 9. How do you switch to another branch?
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
# or the modern command:
git switch <branch_name>
```

### 10. How do you create and switch to a branch in one step?
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
# or
git switch -c <branch_name>
```

### 11. How do you check the status of files in Git?
```bash
git status
```

### 12. How do you add files to staging?
```bash
git add <file_name>
# or add all changes
git add .
```

### 13. How do you commit changes?
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### 14. What is the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?
- `git add`: Moves changes to the **staging area**.
- `git commit`: Saves staged changes into the repository history.

### 15. How do you view commit history?
```bash
git log
```

### 16. How do you see a summarized version of commit history?
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

### 17. What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?
- `git fetch`: Downloads changes but does not merge them.
- `git pull`: Downloads and merges changes from remote into local.

### 18. How do you push changes to a remote repository?
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### 19. How do you configure username and email in Git?
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

### 20. What is `.gitignore`?
A `.gitignore` file specifies **files and directories to be ignored** by Git, such as logs, build artifacts, or environment files.

### 21. How do you remove a file from Git but keep it locally?
```bash
git rm --cached <file>
```

### 22. What is `HEAD` in Git?
`HEAD` is a pointer that refers to the **latest commit in the currently checked-out branch**.

### 23. How do you rename a branch in Git?
```bash
git branch -m <old_name> <new_name>
```

### 24. How do you delete a branch?
```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
# Force delete:
git branch -D <branch_name>
```

### 25. How do you see the difference between commits?
```bash
git diff
```

### 26. How do you unstage a file?
```bash
git reset <file>
```

### 27. How do you undo the last commit but keep changes?
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### 28. How do you discard local changes in a file?
```bash
git checkout -- <file>
```

### 29. How do you stash changes?
```bash
git stash
```

### 30. How do you apply the last stashed changes?
```bash
git stash apply
```

## ðŸŸ¡ Proficient Level (Intermediate)

### 1. What is the difference between a fork and a branch?
- **Branch**: Exists within a repository for feature development.
- **Fork**: A complete copy of another repository (often used in open-source contributions).

### 2. What is the difference between `merge` and `rebase`?
- **Merge**: Creates a new merge commit, preserving history.
- **Rebase**: Moves commits on top of another branch, creating a linear history.

- Open conflicting files.
- Edit to resolve conflicts.
- Mark as resolved:
```bash
git add <file>
git commit
```

### 4. What is a detached HEAD state?
Occurs when `HEAD` points directly to a commit instead of a branch. Any new commits wonâ€™t belong to a branch.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0"
```

### 6. How do you list all tags?
```bash
git tag
```

### 7. How do you push a specific tag to remote?

`git cherry-pick <commit>` applies a specific commit from one branch to another.

### 9. How do you revert a commit?
```bash
git revert <commit_id>
```

### 10. Difference between `git reset` and `git revert`?
- **reset**: Moves HEAD to a specific commit (can alter history).
- **revert**: Creates a new commit that undoes changes.

### 11. What are Git hooks?
Scripts that run automatically on events (e.g., pre-commit, pre-push).

### 12. How do you squash multiple commits into one?
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n

```bash
git commit --amend
```

### 14. How do you see which branches contain a specific commit?
```bash
git branch --contains <commit>
```

### 15. How do you remove untracked files?
```bash
git clean -f
```

### 16. How do you remove untracked directories as well?
```bash
git clean -fd
```

### 17. What is the difference between `origin` and `upstream`?
- **origin**: Default remote repository.
- **upstream**: Typically refers to the original repository from which a fork was made.

### 18. How do you track a remote branch?
```bash
git checkout --track origin/<branch>
```

### 19. How do you see remote URLs?
```bash
git remote -v
```

### 20. How do you change a remote repository URL?
```bash

```bash
git checkout <branch>
git cherry-pick <commit>
```

### 23. What is the reflog in Git?
`git reflog` shows a log of all HEAD movements, useful for recovering lost commits.

### 24. How do you see changes introduced by a commit?

```

### 26. How do you archive a Git repository?
```bash
git archive --format=zip HEAD > repo.zip
```

### 27. What is the difference between shallow and full clone?
- **Shallow clone**: Limited commit history (`--depth=1`).
- **Full clone**: Complete history.

### 28. How do you list all branches (local and remote)?
```bash
git branch -a
```

### 29. How do you rename a remote branch?
- Rename locally:
```bash
git branch -m old_name new_name
