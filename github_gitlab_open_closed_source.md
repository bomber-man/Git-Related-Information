# 📂 Open Source vs Closed Source Projects

## 🔹 Open Source Projects
Open source projects are software projects where the **source code is publicly available** and can be modified, distributed, or enhanced by anyone.

### ✅ Advantages of Open Source
- Free to use and modify  
- Encourages collaboration and innovation  
- Large community support  
- Transparency and faster bug fixes  

### ❌ Challenges of Open Source
- May lack dedicated support  
- Security risks if not actively maintained  
- Integration issues in enterprises  

### 🔥 Examples of Open Source Projects
- **Linux** (Operating System)  
- **Apache** (Web Server)  
- **MySQL** (Database)  
- **Kubernetes** (Container Orchestration)  
- **Bagisto** (E-commerce built on Laravel)

## 🔹 Closed Source Projects
Closed source (proprietary) projects are **owned by individuals or organizations**.  
The source code is not available for public modification.

### ✅ Advantages of Closed Source
- Dedicated professional support  
- Strong security (restricted access)  
- Regular updates and maintenance  
- Reliable for enterprise-grade applications  

### ❌ Challenges of Closed Source
- Licensing costs  
- Limited customization  
- Vendor lock-in issues  

### 🔥 Examples of Closed Source Projects
